### Verification of LLM-generated GPU Kernels

Project for ECE584 at UIUC, fall 2025, by Arjun Vedantham and Alex Lee. 

- cuda_translations: Contains all CUDA source files used for testing, along with crafted Dafny models of these kernels. 
- custom_plugin: A clang based libtool plugin for automated verification within Dafny. 
- docs: Writeups/presentations
- esbmc: Tests with ESBMC, another model checker for GPU programs. Not part of our final project flow. 
- Other Dafny files: mostly test files from learning Dafny, including how best to model concurrent systems.
