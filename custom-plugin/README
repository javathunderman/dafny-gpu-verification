## Clang-based CUDA Memory Static Analysis Tool

### Building
Prequisites: You must have `clang`, including `clang-dev` and `llvm` installed (these are both installable via `apt`). We used `llvm-18` for development, though any modern release should work. 

`mkdir build`

`cmake ..`

`make`

This will produce a binary named `assertion_plugin`. 

### Usage
`./assertion_plugin <path to CUDA kernel> -t <path to Dafny template> -o <output Dafny filepath>`

Once the plugin is run, it should attempt to compile your CUDA source file (thereby catching any standard syntax errors), and will produce a Dafny file at the desired location. Within VSCode, Dafny's language support plugin should automatically verify the assertions in the file once the file is opened.
